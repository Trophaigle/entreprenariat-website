Subject: Collaboration proposal – arrangement/orchestration for {ensemble name}

Hello {name or “Dear Artistic Director”},

My name is {your name}. I am an independent arranger/orchestrator and I work on polyphonic music for choir and small orchestra or instrumental ensemble.

I am writing to ask if your ensemble might be interested in a collaboration. I create custom arrangements for strings, winds or mixed ensemble, and I also adapt choral repertoire for instruments and voices.

Because I am developing my portfolio, I am offering my service free of charge for a first project, so you can evaluate the quality of my work without any commitment. I provide the full score and individual parts (PDF).

You can see a presentation of my work here:

If you are interested, I would be happy to discuss what kind of repertoire or project could be relevant for your ensemble. Even a small or simple arrangement is fine for a first step.

Thank you very much for your time.
I hope we can collaborate in the future.

Best regards,
{Your name}
Arranger / Orchestrator
{(optional) City or country}
